# Capacity record

What the pipeline costs on `music-box-dancer` (spec §10.6): time per step and the disk it fills, per
cycle. At the end of v1 these figures are checked against the handover's triggers for moving to an
ephemeral runner: a weekly run over 6–8 h, or steady-state disk over ~300 GB. Each measured run gets a
row, filled in once from its runbook's figures and never changed after that. A run that measures again
gets a new row.

Step times are each step's `duration_s` from its R2 marker (`markers/cycle=<c>/build=<b>/<step>.json`).
`seats` writes no marker, so its time is `time`'s `real`. Sizes are decimal GB. Bronze is the cycle's
zips in R2, silver is the cycle's build under `/data/fundlens/silver`, and gold is the `gold` schema's
tables with their indexes and TOAST.

## Per cycle

Load is the DuckDB → CSV → `COPY` method of ADR-0007, written `<total> (<aggregates> + <copy>)`: the whole
step, then its two halves (DuckDB aggregates and CSV, then `COPY`, indexes and `ANALYZE`).

| Cycle | Date | Build | SHA | Extract s | Seats s | Transform s | Load s | Publish s | Bronze GB | Silver GB | Gold GB | Peak `pipeline` memory | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | 2026-10-31 | `20261031T012553Z` | `d67cec2` | 454 | 5 | 407 | 4.1 (0.84 + 2.21) | 75 | 4.77 | 0.91 | 0.04 | 27.2 GiB | First run: committee-level gold, no resolution ([first-run.md](runbooks/first-run.md), NEU-2046). Publish includes its deliberate 75 s wait before the purge. |

Resolution (M3), the backfill (NEU-2060) and the weekly run (M5) add their own figures here.

## Findings

- **Memory, not time, is the limit (2024 first run).** The transform peaked at 27.2 GiB in `pipeline`, against a
  40 GiB container and DuckDB's 28 GB `memory_limit`: `04_contribution.sql` builds the cycle's whole
  `contribution` table (51,014,276 rows in 2024) in an in-memory DuckDB. In the dev container the same SQL
  failed at 6 GB and 8 GB and completed at 10 GB. Before the backfill (NEU-2060) runs a cycle whose `indiv` is
  larger than 2024's, raise `DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT` within the container or move the transform to a disk-backed
  DuckDB file under `scratch/`. A transform killed for memory uploads nothing, so it fails safe.
- **Gold is small.** The whole `fundlens` database was 49 MB after publish: contributions stay in silver Parquet
  (ADR-0006), and gold holds aggregates only. Load is seconds, not the spec's 10–30 GB estimate (§3.4); that
  estimate assumed donor tables, which arrive in M3.
- **Time:** extract, transform and publish dominate, about 15 minutes end to end, far inside the handover's
  6–8 h trigger for an ephemeral runner.
